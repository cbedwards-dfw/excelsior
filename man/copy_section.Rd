\usage{
copy_section(
  wb,
  from_df,
  from_address,
  to_address,
  sheet,
  check_row_offset = NULL,
  check_col_offset = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{wb}{An openxlsx2 workbook object}

\item{from_df}{A dataframe of the complete sheet that contains the data to copy \emph{from}. Typically generated from \code{readxl::read_excel} with \code{col_names = FALSE} and \verb{.name_repair = "unique_quiet}.}

\item{from_address}{Character string specifying the source cell range (e.g., "A1:C3").}

\item{to_address}{Character string specifying the destination cell range (e.g., "D1:F3")}

\item{sheet}{Character string or numeric index specifying the target sheet}

\item{check_row_offset}{Optional, integer offset identifying the row that should be used to validate that the from/to sections match. Positive values correspond to rows \emph{above} the first row of the addresses specified.}

\item{check_col_offset}{Optional, integer offset identifying the column that should be used to validate that the from/to sections match. Positive values correspond to columns \emph{before} the first column of the addresses specified.}

\item{numeric_flag}{Logical indicating whether data should be converted to numeric (default: TRUE)}

\item{debug_mode}{Logical indicating whether to enable debug mode highlighting (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
Modified workbook object with data copied

\description{
Designed with updating in mind. Copies data from one location to another within an Excel workbook, with optional validation checks for matching reference rows/columns.
This is a safe version of saying "Copy sheet C3:D4 of sheet 1 to E5:F6 of sheet 2".
To support speed, this function takes as arguments the openxlsx2 workbook object  to be updated, and a dataframe to update FROM.
}
\details{
The key feature of this function is optional checking, in which the first column or row of the "from_db"
is checked against a corresponding column or row of the "to_address" to make sure the entries are still appropriate.

As an example, when updating the TAMM template file with a new year's data, we have a rectangular section of locations and their values present in the TAMM and in the input template; we want to update the input template with the new TAMM values. We can code this with cell addresses, identifying that we want to copy from cells "D126:F130" of the TAMM to "D5:F9" of the current sheet of the input template. However, we could encounter problems if users have re-arranged either excel sheet. For this reason, we want to confirm that the location column (which is 1 column to the left of the leftmost cells we're copying) matches. So we provide "check_col_offset = 1" as an argument. This causes the function to check that "C123:C130" of the TAMM matches "C5:C9" of the current sheet of the input template.
